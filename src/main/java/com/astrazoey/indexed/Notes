 - Repair cost for repair materials is adjusted depending on the enchantment type and how enchanted the item is.
 - Repair cost costs no experience when using repair materials.
 - Vanilla repairing with experience is still possible by repairing with tools rather than repair materials.
 - There is now a level cap on tools depending on the tier. It's calculated by the number of total enchantments (including levels). The max count is preset.
 - Enchantments in the anvil no longer require the same level to upgrade, and instead are a sum of the enchantments

 Villagers:

 - Villagers can only trade treasure, & curses. ie: Things you cannot get on an enchanting table.

 - Experience retrieved on death is no longer capped at 7 levels.
 - Enchanted Books can now be found in various structures related to the enchantment. Eg: mining enchantments like fortune, silk touch can be found in Mineshafts

New Enchantments:
 - New "Slow Burn" enchantment for the Elytra which slows down firework velocity but greatly increases their duration.
 - New "Quick Flight" enchantment for the Elytra which speeds up firework velocity but decreases their duration. This enchantment is disabled in the config by default.
 - New "Forgery" enchantment which decreases the repair cost for that tool.
 - New "Keeping" enchantment which has a 60%-100% chance of letting you keep the item after death. Keeping V is 100% but uses up 5 slots so consider this carefully.
 - New "Curse of the Hidden" which makes the item invisible when viewed in first or third person. It still appears on the ground and in the gui.
 - New "Curse of Mystery" that can be applied to loot which hides enchantments.
 - New "Gilded Book" that's crafted with gold and has extremely high enchantability compared to a regular book. It excludes common enchantments.
 - New "Essence" enchantment that only appears in loot on a gold bound book. This enchantment provides a lot of experience when used in a grindstone.
 - New "Debuff Resistance" enchantment which decreases the duration of negative status effects by 10 seconds per level.

New Blocks:
 - New "Crystal Globe" block that that decrements enchantment levels.
 - When the Crystal Globe is fed enough levels and given an amethyst shard, it will grant the player the "Enchanted" status effect and some experience.
 - The Crystal Globe is more efficient when surrounded by amethyst clusters, but using the Globe can destroy the surrounding clusters.

Other New Features:
 - New "Enchanted" status effect that boosts enchanting power by 1 level.
 - Repair items are removed entirely. They are replaced with a new item called "Vitalis" which can repair any item with durability.

Planned:
 - //TODO: Add Curse of Deceit: Item lies about its durability. (or hides durability)
 - //TODO: "Reeling" enchantment for fishing rods which allows the line to be cast further.

BUGS:
 - //BUG: Curse of mystery is broken

Things to think about:
 - //Think: Fortune and Silk Touch are mutex
