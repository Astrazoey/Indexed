New Stuff:
 - New "Slow Burn" enchantment for the Elytra which slows down firework velocity but greatly increases their duration.
 - New "Quick Flight" enchantment for the Elytra which speeds up firework velocity but decreases their duration. This enchantment is disabled in the config by default.
 - New "Forgery" enchantment which decreases the repair cost for that tool.
 - New "Keeping" enchantment which has a 60%-100% chance of letting you keep the item after death. Keeping V is 100% but uses up 5 slots so consider this carefully.
 - New "Curse of the Hidden" which makes the item invisible when viewed in first or third person. It still appears on the ground and in the gui.
 - New "Curse of Mystery" that can be applied to loot which hides enchantments.
 - New "Gilded Book" that's crafted with gold and has extremely high enchantability compared to a regular book. It excludes common enchantments.

 - New "Crystal Globe" block that that decrements enchantment levels.
 - When the Crystal Globe is fed enough levels and given an amethyst shard, it will grant the player the "Enchanted" status effect and some experience.
 - The Crystal Globe is more efficient when surrounded by amethyst clusters, but using the Globe can destroy the surrounding clusters.
 - New "Enchanted" status effect that boosts enchanting power by 1 level.

Planned:
 - //TODO: Curse of Deceit: Item lies about its durability.
 - //TODO: "Reeling" enchantment for fishing rods which allows the line to be cast further.
 - //TODO: Make textures for the Crystal Particle Effect
 - //TODO: Make sounds for the Crystal
 - //TODO: Add Monky's new Enchanted texture
 - //TODO: Nerf Fortune V
 - //TODO: Investigate Gold Bound Book's exclusion of common enchantments
 - //FIXME: Anvil allows Overcharged crafting when Charm's "AnvilImprovementsEnabled" set to true.
 - //FIXME: Keeping enchantment does nothing when Charm's "Totem of Preserving" set to true.
 - //FIXME: Address the Crystal Globe's missing particle texture

Things to think about:
 - //Think: Fortune and Silk Touch are mutex
 - //Think: Think of some more enchantments + curses
