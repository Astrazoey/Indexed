 - Repair cost costs no experience when using repair materials.
 - Vanilla repairing with experience is still possible by repairing with tools rather than repair materials.
 - There is now a level cap on tools depending on the tier. It's calculated by the number of total enchantments (including levels). The max count is preset.
 - Villagers can no longer sell enchanted books that are higher than level 3.
 - Villagers can only trade treasure, & curses. ie: Things you cannot get on an enchanting table.
 - Mending is no longer considered a treasure and is a rare enchantment found in the enchanting table.
 - Silk Touch is now "RARE" instead of "VERY RARE".
 - Nerfed Quick Draw, Sharpness, Knockback, Punch, and Protection (to adjust for level 5 enchantments).
 - Added repair items to tools that don't normally have them (tridents, bows, crossbows, fishing rods, etc).
 - Config included which lets you set max enchantment caps and repair costs for items - including modded items.
 - Riptide tridents can now be used when it's dry, but it will default to usual behavior.
 - Riptide is compatible with Loyalty. The Loyalty effect takes place in dry circumstances.
 - Riptide is compatible with channeling, so you can summon lightning on impact.
 - Riptide Tridents are thrown farther than usual (when used in dry contexts).
 - Experience retrieved on death is no longer capped at 7 levels.

New Stuff:
 - New "Slow Burn" enchantment for the Elytra which slows down firework velocity but greatly increases their duration.
 - New "Quick Flight" enchantment for the Elytra which speeds up firework velocity but decreases their duration. This enchantment is disabled in the config by default.
 - New "Forgery" enchantment which decreases the repair cost for that tool.
 - New "Keeping" enchantment which has a 60%-100% chance of letting you keep the item after death. Keeping V is 100% but uses up 5 slots so consider this carefully.
 - New "Curse of the Hidden" which makes the item invisible when viewed in first or third person. It still appears on the ground and in the gui.
 - New "Curse of Mystery" that can be applied to loot which hides enchantments.
 - New "Gold Bound Book" that's crafted with gold and has extremely high enchantability compared to a regular book.
 - New "Essence" enchantment that only appears in loot on a gold bound book. This enchantment provides a lot of experience when used in a grindstone.

Planned:
 - //TODO: Curse of Deceit: Item lies about its durability.
 - //TODO: "Reeling" enchantment for fishing rods which allows the line to be cast further.
 - //TODO: Make a way to ween off enchantments
 - //TODO: Nerf Fortune V
 - //FIXME: Anvil allows Overcharged crafting when "AnvilImprovementsEnabled" set to true.
 - //FIXME: Keeping enchantment does nothing when Charm's "Totem of Preserving" set to true.

Things to think about:
 - //Think: Fortune and Silk Touch are mutex
 - //Think: Think of some more enchantments + curses
 - //Think: A way to remove one enchantment at a time from a tool?
