Enchanting Overhaul for Fabric Minecraft

This project is an example of my skills using Java. In this project, I am modifying the existing code of Minecraft to include my own additions.

Notable programming feats include:
 - Overhauling a core mechanic using "mixins" which is a method of code injection to change the behavior of an existing codebase
 - Using "Fabric" to create entirely new content. Fabric is a tool which allows for easy implementation of new features without having to decompile the existing code. It also allows for compatibility with other unrelated creations

To find the Java files, click src/main, then click java/com/astrazoey/indexed, and you will see the Java files present.
